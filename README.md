## Unofficial Teardown NVENC Screen Recorder

After installing the Teardown beta on Steam it was apparent how slow FFMPEG CPU encoding is, So I set out to find the correct hardware acceleration commands that would meet the quality that is provided by the default script by the Developers TuxedoLabs.

## Hardware

I've tried to test this on a few PCs to see what the performance is like, below are the specs of those machines.
| CPU | RAM | GPU | Storage (Where teardown saved to) |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| AMD Ryzen 3700X 8-Core Processor | 16GBs DDR4 @ 3000MHz | Gigabyte GeForce RTX™ 3070 VISIONS OC 8G | Seagate ST4000VX077 4TB Hard Drive |
| AMD Ryzen 1500X Quad-Core Processor | 16GBs DDR4 @ 2133MHz | Gigabyte GeForce® 1660 Ti OC 6G | Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD |

## Examples

All tests used the same 1,171 images in a resolution of 4096 x 2160, they can be found [here on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12zOgIjnrMKXSaQHkm2yi_wz5wPzsnlfk/view?usp=sharing)
